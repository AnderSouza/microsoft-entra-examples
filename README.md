# Microsoft Entra Code Samples
This repo was created as an additional resource to this video from my YouTube channel.

It showcases Microsoft Entra's authentication in a JavaScript web application, front end and back end.

## Quick start
Go inside the nodejs folder and replace the environment variables with your Microsoft Entra information.

Then run `pnpm install` and `pnpm start`.

Now go the react folder and do same thing.
